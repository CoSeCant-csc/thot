<p>Thot is an open source toolkit for statistical machine
translation. Originally, Thot incorporated tools to train phrase-based
models. The new version of Thot now includes a state-of-the-art
phrase-based translation decoder as well as tools to estimate all of the
models involved in the translation process. In addition to this, Thot is
also able to incrementally update its models in real time after
presenting an individual sentence pair.</p>

<p>Thot is being developed by <a href="http://personales.upv.es/daormar3/">Daniel Ortiz-Martínez</a>. Daniel is a
member of the <a href="https://www.prhlt.upv.es/">PRHLT research group</a> at the <a href="http://www.upv.es/">Polytechnic University
of Valencia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NEWS: basic usage instructions have been added to the Thot manual</strong></p>

<a id="distribution-details" class="anchor" href="#distribution-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Distribution Details</h2>

<p>Thot has been coded using C, C++ and shell-scripting. Thot is known to
compile on Unix-like and Windows (using Cygwin) systems. See the
"Support" section of this file if you experience problems during
compilation.</p>

<p>It is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>To install Thot, first you need to install the autotools (autoconf,
autoconf-archive, automake and libtool packages in Ubuntu). If you are
planning to use Thot on a Windows platform, you also need to install the
Cygwin environment.</p>

<p>Once the autotools are available (as well as Cygwin if required), you
can proceed with the installation of Thot by following the next sequence
of steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Obtain the package using git:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/daormar/thot.git
</code></pre>

<p>Or <a href="https://github.com/daormar/thot/archive/master.zip">download it in a zip file</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>cd</code> to the directory containing the package's source code and type
<code>./reconf</code></p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>./configure</code> to configure the package</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>make</code> to compile the package</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>make install</code> to install the programs and any data files and
documentation</p></li>
<li><p>You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
code directory by typing <code>make clean</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>By default the files are installed under the /usr/local/ directory (or
similar, depending of the OS you use); however, since Step 5 requires
root privileges, another directory can be specified during Step 3 by
typing:</p>

<pre><code> $ configure --prefix=&lt;absolute-installation-path&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For example, if "user1" wants to install the Thot package in the
directory /home/user1/thot, the sequence of commands to execute should be
the following:</p>

<pre><code> $ ./reconf
 $ configure --prefix=/home/user1/thot
 $ make
 $ make install
</code></pre>

<p>The installation directory can be the same directory where the Thot
package was decompressed.</p>

<p>See "INSTALL" file for more information.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: if Thot is being installed in a PBS cluster (a cluster
providing <code>qsub</code> and other related tools), it is important that the
<code>configure</code> script is executed in the main cluster node, so as to
properly detect the cluster configuration (do not execute it in an
interactive session).</p>

<p>Thot can be combined with the CasMacat Workbench that is being developed
in the project of the same name. <a href="http://www.casmacat.eu/index.php?n=Workbench.Workbench">See this webpage</a> to get the specific
installation instructions.</p>

<h2>
<a id="relation-with-existing-software" class="anchor" href="#relation-with-existing-software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Relation with Existing Software</h2>

<p>Due to the strong focus of Thot on online and incremental learning, it
includes its own programs to carry out language and translation model
estimation. Specifically, Thot includes tools to work with n-gram
language models based on incrementally updateable sufficient
statistics. On the other hand, Thot also includes a set of tools and a
whole software library to estimate IBM 1, IBM 2 and HMM-based word
alignment models. The estimation process can be carried out using batch
and incremental EM algorithms. This functionality is not based on the
standard GIZA++ software for word alignment model generation.</p>

<p>Additionally, Thot does not use any code from other existing translation
tools such as Moses. In this regard, Thot is a smaller project which
tries to offer its own view of the process of statistical machine
translation, with a strong focus on online learning and also
incorporating interactive machine translation functionality.</p>

<h2>
<a id="current-status" class="anchor" href="#current-status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status</h2>

<p>The Thot toolkit is under development. Original public versions of Thot
date back to 2005 [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2005] and were hosted in
SourceForge. These original versions were strongly focused on the
estimation of phrase-based models. By contrast, current version offers
several new features that had not been previously incorporated.</p>

<p>A set of specific tools to ease the process of making SMT experiments
has been created.  Basic usage instructions have been recently added to
the Thot manual.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some toolkit extensions that will be
incorporated in the next few months:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Virtualized language models (i.e. accessing language model parameters
from disk).</p></li>
<li><p>Interpolation of language and translation models.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved concurrency in the Thot translation server (translation
process is not still concurrent).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, here is a list of known issues with the Thot toolkit that are
currently being addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phrase model training is based on HMM-based word alignment models
estimated by means of incremental EM. The current implementation is
slow and currently constitutes a bottleneck when training phrase
models from large corpora. One already implemented solution is to
carry out the estimation in multiple processors. However, we are also
investigating alternative optimization techniques than allow us to
efficiently execute the estimation process in a single processor.</p></li>
<li><p>Log-linear model weight adjustment is carried out by means of the
downhill simplex algorithm, which is very slow. Downhill simplex will
be replaced by a more efficient technique.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-monotonic translation is not yet sufficiently tested, specially
with complex corpora such as Europarl.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information about the theoretical foundations of Thot can be
found in [Ortiz-Martínez, 2011]. One interesting feature of Thot,
incremental (or online) estimation of statistical models, is also
described in [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2010]. Finally, phrase-level
alignment generation functionality implemented in Thot was proposed in
[Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2008].</p>
