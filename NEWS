Thot 3.0.0

	=> The project has been restarted. Backward compatibility with
	previous versions of Thot is not ensured.

	=> Lots of new features have been added:

        - Phrase-based statistical machine translation decoder

	- Computer-aided translation (post-edition and interactive machine
	translation)

	- Incremental estimation of all of the models involved in the
	translation process

	- Client-server implementation of the translation functionality

	- Single word alignment model estimation using the incremental EM
	algorithm

	- Scalable implementation of the different estimation algorithms
	using Map-Reduce

	- Integration with the [CasMaCat Workbench] [4] developed in the
	[CasMaCat project] [5]

	- ...
